## Introduction

Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses to understand their customer base and target their marketing efforts effectively. In this project, we use unsupervised learning algorithms to segment customers based on their purchase history and other attributes. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments that can be targeted with personalized marketing campaigns.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirmsk/customer_segmentation.git
cd customer_segmentation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and ensure it is in the correct format.
2. Run the data preprocessing script to clean and preprocess the data.
3. Execute the customer segmentation algorithm to identify customer segments.
4. Analyze the results and visualize the segments.

Example commands:

```bash
python preprocess_data.py --input data/raw/customers.csv --output data/processed/customers_clean.csv
python segment_customers.py --input data/processed/customers_clean.csv --output results/segments.csv
python visualize_segments.py --input results/segments.csv
```
